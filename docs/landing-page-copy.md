## Problem Statement

### The Pain: Non-Billable Toil

**40% of your week is stolen.**

Freelancers and consultants spend an average of **15-20 hours every month** on tasks that don't generate revenue:
- Meeting notes that take 30 minutes to write
- Follow-up emails that sit in your drafts folder
- Status reports that nobody reads but everyone demands
- Client summaries that consume your Sunday evenings

**That's 240 hours a year.** Time you'll never bill. Time you'll never get back.

**What if you could hire someone to handle all of it—for $4.99 a month?**

### Meet Workie: Your Dedicated Freelancer Admin Agent

Workie isn't a chatbot. It's not a generic AI assistant. It's a **dedicated employee** that lives in your workflow, learns your clients, and executes the tedious work you hate.

**Three Reasons Workie Wins:**

1. **Persistence:** Workie never forgets, never gets tired, and works on *your* schedule (Monday mornings, Friday afternoons, or 3 AM—your call).

2. **Precision:** Powered by Google Gemini 2.5, Workie extracts decisions, assigns action items, and drafts emails with the tone and structure you define.

## Killer Feature Deep Dive

### The 30-Second Workflow That Saves You 60 Minutes

**Here's how it works:**

You just finished a client call. The transcript is messy. The action items are buried. The client expects a follow-up email by end of day.

**Before Workie:**
- 30 minutes: Transcribe and summarize the call
- 15 minutes: Extract action items and assign owners
- 15 minutes: Draft a professional follow-up email

**Total:** 60 minutes of unbillable labor.

**With Workie:**
1. Upload the transcript (10 seconds)
2. Click "Run Agent" (1 second)
3. Receive structured output (20 seconds)

**Total:** 30 seconds.

**What You Get:**

✅ **Key Decisions:** A clean, 3-point summary of what was agreed upon.  
✅ **Action Items:** Specific tasks with assigned owners, ready to delegate.  
✅ **Draft Email:** Professional, client-ready follow-up in your brand voice.

**Example Output:**

> **Key Decisions:**
> - Client approved Q4 rebrand design layout
> - Marketing budget frozen at $15k
> - Branding deadline moved to Friday
>
> **Action Items:**
> - Sarah: Finalize platform branding by Friday
> - Joe: Submit Q3 failure summary by Wednesday
> - Manager: Send contract addendum
>
> **Draft Email:**
> "Hi Team, following our sync call, here's a quick recap..."

Copy. Paste. Send. Done.

## Transparency & Trust

### You Only Pay for What You Use

Most AI tools hide their costs behind vague "unlimited" plans or enterprise pricing. We don't.

**Workie uses a Hybrid Subscription Model:**

- **Fixed Monthly Fee:** $4.99 to $39.99 (depending on your tier)
- **Token Allocation:** Every plan includes a monthly quota (50,000 to 1,000,000 tokens)
- **Top-Ups:** If you go over, buy more tokens for $3.00 (100,000 tokens)

**Why this works:**
- **Transparency:** Your dashboard shows *exactly* how many tokens you've used and how many remain.
- **Fairness:** You're not subsidizing enterprise users. You pay for your usage.
- **Predictability:** 95% of users never exceed their quota. If you do, top-ups are instant and cheap.

**Our Promise:** No surprise bills. No hidden fees. No asterisks.
