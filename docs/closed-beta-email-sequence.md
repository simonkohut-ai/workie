# Workie Closed Beta Email Launch Sequence

## Email 1: The Announcement (Immediate Send)

**Subject Line:** Stop Doing Admin: Your Workie Agent Is Ready for Hire.

---

Hey there,

I'm reaching out because I think you're tired of doing the same thing I was: spending hours on admin work that doesn't make you money.

**Workie is live.**

It's an AI agent built specifically for freelancers and consultants who are drowning in non-billable tasks. You know the drill: endless meeting notes, follow-up emails, status reports, and client summaries that eat up 5-10 hours every week.

Here's what Workie does:
- Takes your meeting transcripts and instantly generates summaries, action items, and draft emails.
- Runs on a schedule you set (Monday mornings, Friday afternoons—whatever works).
- Tracks every token it uses, so you're never surprised by a bill.

**This is a closed beta.** We're only accepting 100 founding members, and you're on the list because you're the type of professional we built this for.

**To claim your founding member spot, reply to this email.**

That's it. No forms, no landing pages. Just reply, and I'll send you the details.

Talk soon,

## Email 2: Deep Dive (Sent 24 hours after Email 1)

**Subject Line:** From Transcript to Draft Email in 30 Seconds.

---

Hey,

Yesterday I told you about Workie. Today, I want to show you exactly how it works—and why it's the fastest way to turn meeting chaos into action.

**The Killer Feature: Transcript → Draft Email**

Here's the workflow:

1. **Configure:** Tell Workie your role and your client's name. (Takes 2 minutes, one time.)
2. **Automate:** Upload a meeting transcript or connect your calendar. Workie processes it using Gemini 3.
3. **Deliver:** You get a summary, a list of action items, and a ready-to-send email draft.

**Time saved per meeting:** 45-60 minutes.

That's not hyperbole. We timed it. The average consultant spends 30 minutes writing notes, 15 minutes drafting an email, and another 10-15 minutes organizing action items. Workie does all three in under a minute.

**Here's what one beta tester said:**

> "I used to spend Sunday evenings catching up on client emails. Now I click a button, and it's done."

**The pricing is simple:**
- **Micro Tier:** $4.99/month (50,000 tokens)
- **Flow Tier:** $14.99/month (250,000 tokens)
- **Pro Tier:** $39.99/month (1M tokens)

No hidden fees. If you go over, you can buy a top-up for $3 (100,000 tokens). We track every token and show you exactly what you're using.

**To learn more about the tiers and join the closed beta, reply 'FLOW' to this email.**

Cheers,  
Sy

## Email 3: Scarcity & Urgency (Sent 48 hours after Email 1)

**Subject Line:** Last Chance: Limited Founding Spots Remain.

---

Hey,

This is the final email about Workie's closed beta.

We opened up 100 founding member spots two days ago. As of this morning, **72 are claimed.**

If you've been on the fence, here's what you need to know:

**Why join now:**
1. **Founding Member Pricing:** Lock in $4.99/month for life (Micro Tier). This price goes up after beta.
2. **Direct Access to the Team:** You'll have a direct line to me and our engineers. Your feedback shapes the product.
3. **Transparency Guarantee:** Every token is tracked. No surprise bills. Ever.

**What you get immediately:**
- The Freelancer Admin Agent (live and running).
- Transcript-to-email automation.
- Usage tracking dashboard.
- Priority support.

**This is the last call.**

We're capping the beta at 100 members because we want to give each founding member white-glove support. After that, we're closing the doors until we've refined the product based on your feedback.

**Confirm your spot by replying 'WORKIE' now.**

Let's eliminate the admin work together.
